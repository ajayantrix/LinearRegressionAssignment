## General Information
US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes
- suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing COVID pandemic
- Finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario
- Needs a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenues as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end

The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

Business Goal:
Model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. Management will use this to understand how the demands vary with different features. And accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
